TODO (SMT11):
=============================

- use new installation.xml and test it according to bnc #377154

- STAGING:
  If staging is enabled for a catalogs, find out all products for which this 
  catalog is used. Find all catalogs for these products and create symlinks 
  in full/ and testing/ for all catalogs where staging is not enabled.
  This is required to successfully register clients against the testing 
  or full namespace if only one of X catalogs are enabled for staging.

  If staging is enabled for an already existing (mirrored) catalog, 
  hardlink or copy the current content to full and testing.


- enhance setup-custom-catalogs to allow configuration of repositories
  of type NU .

- fix smt-db: add "cpw" to help() and check chown of smt.conf (may make trouble with
              smt user). 
 

Nice-To-Have but not so important
=================================

- flagCatalogs should show new and removed mirrorable catatalogs.

- verify checksum of /repodata/repomd.xml

- Do we need to provide a keyring and accept new keys? 
  Talk to security-team about this.

  Talked to security-team: This is nice to have but no requirement
  because the client are checking the repomd too.

- provide --config <configfile> options for the smt commands to
  use a different configfile then /etc/smt.conf 



DONE:
=====

- configure the smt user via smt.conf?
  With the possibility to disable user switching?

- regserver URL in smt.conf? 
  If not available , fallback to suseRegister.conf?

- In the parser we print errors if we found invalid XML syntax but ignore them. 
  We should return errors and count them in SLE11.

- better mirror report. Shorter with more informations. 

- move the re-try on error loops into Job::mirror() function. Then we have the
  code one time and not X times in the code.

- idea to speed-up mirroring by integrating the hardlink feature.
  * create a table in DB with key = <rpm-name>-<checksum> and path
    column
  * during mirror, when fetching a new rpm, first look into DB if we
    have it already. If yes, create a hardlink (or copy) instead of
    downloading it from the network.
    If we do not have it yet, download it and create a database entry

- idea to speep-up mirroring by "diffing" repodata/
  * parse repodata/ and .repodata/ and find out which files are changed or 
    new. After having this list, download only these files.
    [implemented in a different way]

- Add Yum.pm, which mirror the headers/ dir and then call RpmMd.pm
  This is more straight forward then doing everything in RpmMd.pm 

- yast2-smt: Checking if /etc/zypp/credentials.d/NCCcredentials file
             exists. If it doesn't user is offered to run registration,
             create the file off-line (using registration API) or
             skip it (FATE #305540).

- yast2-smt: Checking the permissions of /etc/zypp/credentials.d/NCCcredentials
             the user defined in LOCAL->smtUser needs read access to this file.
             At first trying to use ACL, then chown + chmod if it fails
             (FATE #305540).

- yast2-smt: New "Plugged world" icon (FATE #306264).

- yast2-smt: Added UI interface to handle catalogs states (mirroring, staging)
             (FATE #304491).

- yast2-smt: Added UI to handle patches 'testing/ignored' states

- yast2-smt: Added SCR agent to handle staging

- New SMT::Support Perl module to handle uploading the supportconfig
  profiles for NTS.

- Created new Repositories.pm Perl module (AKA Catalogs) in smt package

- yast2-smt: Using Repositories.pm from SCR agent

- Extended smt-mirror script to select just one --repository to mirror.
  Needed for YaST. Currently working with unique repository ID.

Rejected:
=========

- 2. e-mail address for admin mails.
  (e.g. smt-mirror --mail)
  Reason: we use one address for all.
