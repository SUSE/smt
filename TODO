  - verify checksum of /repodata/repomd.xml

  - Do we need to provide a keyring and accept new keys? 
    Talk to security-team about this.

  Talked to security-team: This is nice to have but no requirement

}

- client tool for setting/initializing the "Mirrorable" flag
  in the Catalogs table:
  * update Catalogs SET Mirrorable='N'
  * download repo/repoindex.xml, parse it and set the
    available catalogs to 'Y' again.
  * try to access repomd.xml of all YUM catalogs and set
    the "Mirroable" flags to 'Y' again

- client tool to view all mirrorable catalogs and change the
  "DoMirror" Flag on demand.

- write yast module for initial setup
  * ask for Mirror Credentials
  * append "perl" to /etc/sysconfig/apache2 APACHE_MODULES
  * start apache
  * insserv apache
  * start database initialization (ncc-mirror.pl)
  * NiceToHave: configuration of a cronjob vor yep-mirror.pl
