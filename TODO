Nice-To-Have but not so important
=================================

- verify checksum of /repodata/repomd.xml

- Do we need to provide a keyring and accept new keys? 
  Talk to security-team about this.

  Talked to security-team: This is nice to have but no requirement
  because the client are checking the repomd too.


TODO next SP or SLE11 version
=============================

- provide --config <configfile> options for the smt commands to
  use a different configfile then /etc/smt.conf 

- use new installation.xml and test it according to bnc #377154

- idea to speed-up mirroring by integrating the hardlink feature.
  * create a table in DB with key = <rpm-name>-<checksum> and path
    column
  * during mirror, when fetching a new rpm, first look into DB if we
    have it already. If yes, create a hardlink (or copy) instead of
    downloading it from the network.
    If we do not have it yet, download it and create a database entry

- idea to speep-up mirroring by "diffing" repodata/
  * parse repodata/ and .repodata/ and find out which files are changed or 
    new. After having this list, download only these files.

- Add Yum.pm, which mirror the headers/ dir and then call RpmMd.pm
  This is more straight forward then doing everything in RpmMd.pm 

- better mirror report. Shorter with more informations. 

DONE:
=====

- move the re-try on error loops into Job::mirror() function. Then we have the
  code one time and not X times in the code.
