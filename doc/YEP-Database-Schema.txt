Registration(GUID         CHAR(50) NOT NULL,
             PRODUCTID    integer NOT NULL,
             REGDATE      TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
             NCCREGDATE   TIMESTAMP DEFAULT '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
             PRIMARY KEY(GUID, ProductID)
            );

GUID:       The ID of the client machine (/etc/zmd/deviceid)
PRODUCTID:  The ID of the Product which is installed on this client
            This ID is a reference to the Products table, PRODUCTDATAID column
REGDATE:    Timestamp when a client registered this product
NCCREGDATE: Timestamp when this registration was registered at NCC

This table is changed with every registration. 
It happens DELETE, UPDATE and INSERT statements during registration.

Expected table size: depends on how many clients are registered against YEP 
                     and how many products they have installed.

This table is changed with every registration. 
It happens DELETE and INSERT statements during registration.

Expected table size: depends on how many clients are registered against YEP 
                     Every GUID will have around 20 rows in this table.

LOCALPATH:    Path on YEP where this catalog can be found
              (this is not a full path! The full path can be build this way:
               <BasePath>/repo/<LOCALPATH>/

               apache DocumentRoot)
