1. Functionality:

This software is able to mirror a selection of individual catalogs
coming from NU services and yum repositories, and allows for grouping
of catalogs under name, and assignement of devices to certain group.

The catalog exposes a url which serves a dynamic repoindex.xml for
consumption. The repoindex lists the catalogs belonging to the group
where this device is assigned.

In addition, a device could subscribe to catalogs directly.

2. Components:

2.1 Configuration

Configuration and state data overlap. Decision to be
made what belongs to the database and what to configuration.

- repositories and catalogs to mirror
- groups of catalogs

Example (rails yml):

-------------------------------------
mirror.yml

nu.novell:
  url: https://user:pass@nu.novell.com
  type: nu
  catalogs: SLED10-SP1-Updates,SLE10-SP1-Debuginfo-Updates

10.3-update:
  url: http://download.opensuse.org/update/10.3
  path: /foo

-------------------------------------
groups.yml

group1: SLED10-SP1-Updates,SLE10-SP1-Debuginfo-Updates,10.3-update

-------------------------------------

Catalogs coming from NU repositories need a query to the NU server to get their
paths and targets. This information needs to be cached somehow.

Listing of available catalogs for a set of mirroring credentials can be
retrieved requesting https://nu.novell.com with basic authentication.

<repoindex>
  <repo name="SLE10-SDK-Updates" alias="SLE10-SDK-Updates" description="SLE10-SDK-Updates for sles-10-i586" distro_target="sles-10-i586" priority="0" pub="0" path="$RCE/SLE10-SDK-Updates/sles-10-i586"/>
  .. more ..
</repoindex>

2.2 Repository Server

Web service that when called as:

http://guuid@serverurl

returns a repoindex with the appropiate catalogs for the group where that
machine belongs.

2.3 Mirroring

This component takes the configuration and downloads the selected catalogs from configured NU
servers.

The mirror component should read the repoindex of each NU service, and then read the
repomd.xml of each catalog. It should download all metadata files and recursiverly also
read metadata files which contains reference to other resources which have to be
downloaded.
